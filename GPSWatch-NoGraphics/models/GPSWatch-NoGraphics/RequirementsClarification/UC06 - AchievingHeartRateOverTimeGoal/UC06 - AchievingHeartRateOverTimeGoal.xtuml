	'Pre-conditions
	No Track logs exist on the device.
	Timer is stopped.
	Elapsed time is zero. 
	Accumulated distance is zero.
	Display shows elapsed time and accumulated distance.

Scenario
	1.  User establishes a single goal of maintaining a bounded heart rate over a period of time.
	2.	User pushes the start/stop button and begins moving (walking, running, flying, cycling, etc.).
	3.	The timer starts.
	4.  User pushes the Mode button until heart rate is displayed.
	5.	The display shows:
		a.	Current heart rate
		b.	Elapsed time
	6.  Periodically throughout the workout the device stores the current heart rate of the user.
	7.	User pushes Set Target button.
	8.	Evaluation of the goal starts.
	9.  The device stores an indication of when during the workout the goal is being met.
	    In this case the goal is being met throughout the duration of the goal.
	10.	The display shows:
		a.	Current heart rate
		b.	Elapsed time
		c.  An indication of whether the current goal conditon is being met.
	11.	User pushes the start/stop button.
	12.	The timer stops.
	13. The elapsed time, distance, and heart rate samples stop accumulating.');
